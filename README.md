## What is it?
A set of scripts to generate clean tree representations of chess openings.

![queen's gambit tree](/static/qg.png)

## Dataset
Uses the [Lichess database of openings.](https://github.com/lichess-org/chess-openings) Interestingly, in this dataset, not all variations of every opening are prefixed with that opening's name. In particular, the Slav (D10) is notated simply as "Slav Defense." The search criteria for the Queen's Gambit needed several revisions to include every variation.

## Stack
Python and D3.js.
